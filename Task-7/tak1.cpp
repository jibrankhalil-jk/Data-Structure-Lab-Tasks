// You are tasked with developing an application for a cafeteria ordering using a queue data structure
// implemented with a linked list in C++. The cafeteria serves a variety of food items and beverages, and
// the system must efficiently manage incoming orders while ensuring that they are processed in the order
// they are received.
// Requirements:
// 1. Menu Display: The application should display a menu of available food items and beverages, along
// with their corresponding prices.
// 2. Order Placement: Customers should be able to place orders by selecting items from the menu. Each
// order should be added to a queue for processing.
// 3. Order Processing: Orders should be processed in the order they are received. As orders are
// processed, they should be removed from the queue, and the next order should be displayed.
// 4. Queue Management: The application should provide options to add new orders, remove processed
// orders, and display the current orders in the queue.
